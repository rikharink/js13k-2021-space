# TODO

## Should Have

- [ ] bounce particles
- [ ] bounce physics (prevent "weird" backwards bounce)
- [ ] Better GFX
- [ ] sfx
- [ ] visualize ball position when OOB

## Nice to have

- [ ] Music
- [ ] Pimp UI
  - [ ] General looks
  - [ ] current hole
  - [ ] average launches per hole
- [ ] debug collisions (seems it might be possible to kill moon speed with collision and it seems to be possible to pass through the moon without colliding)

## Stretch goals

- [ ] decentralization
- [ ] achievements
- [ ] shareable hole replay
- [ ] astroid fields
- [ ] planets orbiting suns

## Level Generation TODO

- [ ] Generate moons
- [ ] Generate more difficult levels depending on current level (more planets in the way (with moons) the higher level)
  - [ ] heuristic number of planets that collide with the line between spawn and goal planet?
